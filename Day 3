Today's progress: I was studying necessary concepts for performing pre-processing and preparing data before using it.
I couldn't finish the decision tree tutorial today, so I'll postpone it for tomorrow. 

Thoughts: in two days time I'll be focusing on everything about preprocessing. The post will contain:
1- Introduction
2- Cleaning
3- Exploration
4- Transformation
5- Dimensionality reduction
